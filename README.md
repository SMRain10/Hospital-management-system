# Healthcare Database Management System

This collaborative project has developed a standalone Java application with a MySQL database to manage healthcare data. A user-friendly GUI interfaces directly with the SQL database, enforcing data quality and relationships through foreign keys, attribute data types, cascading, and triggers. Role-based access control is implemented, allowing different user types to perform specific tasks once they log in. The roles include administrators, medical staff, and guests/new patients, each with their own set of functionalities and access privileges. 

Triggers automate bill creation when procedures, prescriptions, lab tests, or doctor visits are recorded. The database ensures data consistency and integrity during SQL operations.
